# Identifying a Need


**Problem/Need:** The "3D Roll a Ball" game is a basic simulation designed to provide a fun and engaging way to improve hand-eye coordination, spatial awareness, and motor skills. It can serve as an educational tool for younger players to develop cognitive skills while offering a simple and accessible gaming experience for casual gamers. The need addressed by this game is to provide a simple yet effective tool for enhancing these basic skills in a virtual, interactive environment. Additionally, it can act as an introduction to game mechanics and control in 3D space for beginner players or developers.

# Requirements Outline

**Inputs:**

**Player Controls:**
Mouse or keyboard inputs (e.g., arrow keys or WASD) to control the movement of the ball.
Optional controller input (e.g., joystick).

**Camera Movement:**
Adjustments for camera views controlled via the mouse or a specific key for toggling camera angles.
Collision Detection:
Inputs triggered when the ball hits obstacles, walls, or pickups (e.g., points to collect).

**Processing:**
Physics Calculations:
Gravity and momentum for rolling the ball in the 3D environment.
Collision detection and resolution with walls and game objects.
Player input handling for ball movement.

**Scoring System:**
Processing of score updates when the ball interacts with specific items (e.g., point objects).
Game State Management:
Keeping track of the game progress, levels, or timed challenges.
Outputs:

**On-Screen Visuals:**
A 3D-rendered environment with objects, walls, and a ball in motion.
Score Display:
Visual updates of the playerâ€™s score on-screen in real-time.
Win/Loss Conditions:
Visual or auditory feedback when objectives are met (e.g., collecting all points) or when the player fails (e.g., timer runs out).

**Physics Feedback:**
Real-time rendering of ball movements, reactions to collisions, and changes in velocity.
Transmission:
Multiplayer Mode (Optional):
Data transmission between players for real-time positioning and movements (if networked multiplayer mode is considered).
**Storage:**

Game Progress:
Save files for level progression, player scores, or customizable settings.
Settings and Preferences:
Player preferences for control schemes, camera angles, and difficulty levels.
